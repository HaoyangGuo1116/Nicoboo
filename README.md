# Nicoboo

Nicoboo is a lightweight iOS app designed to support people who want to quit smoking through simple tracking and positive motivation.

The app helps users visualize their progress by showing how long they have stayed smoke-free, how many cigarettes they have avoided, and how much money they have saved. Users can also set personal saving goals to turn their quitting journey into something tangible and rewarding.

Nicoboo focuses on being a supportive companion rather than a strict tracker, encouraging users to stay motivated through small wins and clear feedback.
